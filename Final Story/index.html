            <p>College Park has long been a home to University of Maryland students, but the city’s housing market is becoming increasingly unaffordable for those who live off-campus. Apartments in close proximity to campus now average around $1,800 per month, according to <a href="https://www.apartments.com/rent-market-trends/college-park-md/">Apartments.com</a>. This cost only seems to increase each year. For students relying on financial aid, part-time jobs, or family support, these costs can make finding affordable and convenient housing feel like an impossible task.</p>
            <p>The trend has intensified as the city invests in luxury apartment complexes such as Aspen Heights, Terrapin Row, and The Hub. While these developments provide a variety of modern amenities and walking distance from campus, they often cost far beyond what the average student can afford.</p>

            <h3>Students Face Skyrocketing Apartment Costs</h3>
            <p>For junior criminology and criminal justice major Hayley Sims, the financial strain is a consistent concern. She rents an apartment off-campus with three roommates and works part-time to cover her expenses.</p>
            <p>“It’s definitely a more expensive option,” Sims said. “I worry about rent pretty often, and I kind of wish there were cheaper options.”</p>
            <p>Sims’ experience illustrates a common issue for upperclassmen. According to data gathered by <a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/university-of-maryland-2103/student-life">U.S. News and World Report</a>, “39% of the students live in college-owned, operated or affiliated housing and 61% of students live off campus.” While campus housing offers more reasonable costs, many students find that off-campus housing has more to offer.</p>
            <p>“I signed my lease pretty early, before the prices increased,” Sims added. “I really don’t know how students can afford these prices now.”</p>

            <h3>Balancing Cost and Convenience</h3>
            <p>Freshman psychology major Kay Lindhorst, living in a traditional dorm, sees both sides of the housing debate. </p>
            <p>“Dorm life is fun, even if space is limited, but it gives you security and some peace of mind cost-wise,” Lindhorst said.</p>
            <p>Lindhorst went on to explain her process of searching for an apartment for the upcoming year and the difficulties she faced while finding an affordable option.</p>
            <p>“Honestly, every unit I looked at was so expensive. The one I decided to go with had a pretty high cost, but the amenities are so good,” Lindhorst said. “So it's a balance. You get what you pay for.”</p>
            <p>One of the most significant reasons students seem to be pushed off campus after freshman year is the lack of options for upperclassmen. The university’s <a href="https://reslife.umd.edu/terp-housing/additional-housing-options">Department of Resident Life</a> recommends that juniors and seniors apply to live in the South Campus Commons community, which consists of campus apartments, with little alternatives available.</p>

            <p>Lindhorst explained the pressures she felt while searching for an apartment early on into the semester. She found that most rising sophomores would prefer to live off-campus, choosing to ditch dorm life as early as possible.</p>


            <div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 0px; padding: 100% 0px 0px; overflow: hidden; will-change: transform;"><iframe loading="lazy" style="position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; top: 0px; left: 0px; border: medium; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" src="https://e.infogram.com/56a90348-b3db-4912-878f-1e92c5cbbdd2?src=embed&amp;embed_type=responsive_iframe" title="" allowfullscreen="" allow="fullscreen"></iframe></div><div style="padding: 8px 0px; font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px; text-align: center; border-top: 1px solid rgb(218, 218, 218); margin: 0px 30px;"><a href="https://infogram.com" style="color: rgb(152, 152, 152); text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infogram</a></div>

            <p>Sophomore kinesiology major Cassandra Farren reinforced this sentiment. She explained that she is the only one of her friends that is still living on campus as an underclassmen.</p>
            <p>“Living in an on-campus apartment has been a really good option for me, and is definitely cheaper than renting off-campus,” Farren said. “But I will say that everyone I know that lives off-campus loves it and seems to be okay with paying extra because of all the amenities they offer.”</p>
            <p>Sims said that the pressure of moving off campus as soon as possible results in landlords raising rents in response to high demand.</p>
            <p>“I think that the luxury developments cater to students who can afford the better amenities,” Sims said.  “So the older, more affordable apartment complexes are harder to find. It just makes it so much more difficult for students to find a place to live.”</p>
            <p>As College Park’s rental market continues to change, students face difficult decisions that could affect not only their finances but also their academic success and quality of life.</p>
            <p>“I think if there were better options for upperclassmen, I would want to stay on campus, but that just was not the case,” Lindhorst said.</p>
